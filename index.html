      <h1>Forgotten Survival Foods<br>That Last for Years</h1>
      <p>
        Long before supermarkets and refrigeration, families and military planners
        relied on powerful foods designed to survive chaos.

    <h2>Why Modern Emergency Food Often Fails</h2>
    <p>
      Most emergency food plans depend on electricity, supply chains,
      or ultra-processed storage meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical survival foods were different — simple ingredients,
      no refrigeration, and proven during war, famine, and long isolation.

  <section class="section light fade-up">
    <h2>A Simple Question</h2>
    <p>
      If stores closed tomorrow and power stayed off for weeks,
      would your food keep you strong — or just full?
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference isn’t quantity.  
      It’s knowledge that most people have forgotten.
